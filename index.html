<p style="color:Grey; font-size:200%;">Our chosen category for promoting the fundraiser is Video Blog.</p>
<br>

<p style="color:Grey; font-size:150%;">The reason for this being that with Video Blog, we can further promote the fundraiser concert through videos uploaded online. 
    That way, people around the world can be notified about the fundraiser. 
    It will also help to make people online aware of the situation happening in Sitio Bebe and how they can help by attending the fundraiser concert. 
    People who wish to attend the concert but can't due to the pandemic will be able to watch the process of planning the concert, the performance of Ben&Ben, 
    and the visit to Sitio Bebe for the distribution of the funds that came from the concert.</p>
